We found that while life satisfaction plateaus, moment-to-moment emotional well-being continues to rise with income logarithmically, resolving the paradox by distinguishing between evaluative and experienced happiness.",1,AI Generated (Gemini Studio)
"We analyze the iconography of the ""Green Man"" in medieval church architecture. Using a dataset of 5,000 carvings, we tracked the motif's evolution from a pagan fertility symbol to a Christian representation of sin and resurrection. We argue that the Green Man acted as a liminal apotropaic device, bridging the gap between folk religion and orthodox theology.",1,AI Generated (Gemini Studio)
"The impact of gentrification on long-term residents is often measured by displacement. We propose a ""Cultural Displacement"" index based on the closure of ""third places"" (barbershops, churches). Our analysis of Brooklyn neighborhoods shows that even when physical displacement is low, the loss of cultural amenities leads to a significant decline in mental health and community cohesion among original residents.",1,AI Generated (Gemini Studio)
"We investigate the ""Sleeper Effect"" in political persuasion. Voters were exposed to negative campaign ads from a non-credible source. Immediately, the message had no effect.

The psychological mechanism mirrors gambling addiction, prompting a call for regulatory classification as gambling.",1,AI Generated (Gemini Studio)
"The ""Bystander Effect"" is a staple of social psychology. We replicated the classic experiment in a Virtual Reality environment. Surprisingly, we found that the presence of AI avatars reduced the bystander effect; participants were more likely to intervene in an emergency when surrounded by virtual agents than when alone, suggesting that the ""diffusion of responsibility"" does not transfer to artificial social entities.",1,AI Generated (Gemini Studio)
"We analyze the supply chain resilience of the global coffee trade. Using network theory, we modeled the flow of Arabica beans. We identify a critical bottleneck in the port infrastructure of Vietnam and Brazil. A simulated disruption at these nodes causes a cascading failure more severe than climate shocks, highlighting the fragility of just-in-time logistics in commodity markets.",1,AI Generated (Gemini Studio)
"The art market is often considered irrational. We applied a ""Hedonic Regression"" model to 50 years of auction data. We found that while ""aesthetic quality"" (rated by experts) has a marginal effect on price, ""provenance"" (ownership history) and ""artist brand"" explain 80% of the price variance. This confirms that art functions primarily as a signaling good and financial asset class.",1,AI Generated (Gemini Studio)
"We investigate the cognitive load of ""Zoom Fatigue."" Using EEG, we measured theta/beta ratios during video conferencing versus face-to-face meetings. We found that the millisecond audio delays and lack of mutual gaze in video calls require significantly higher sustained attention processing, leading to faster neural exhaustion and reduced working memory capacity.",1,AI Generated (Gemini Studio)
"The collapse of the Maya civilization is often attributed to drought. We analyzed the settlement patterns using LiDAR in the Petén Basin.

This suggests that political instability and warfare, rather than climate alone, determined resilience.",1,AI Generated (Gemini Studio)
"We explore the ""Paradox of Choice"" in online dating. We analyzed the swipe data of 100,000 users. Users presented with more profiles reported lower satisfaction with their eventual matches and a higher rate of ""ghosting."" This supports the hypothesis that algorithmic abundance devalues individual connections and induces a ""maximization"" mindset that hinders relationship formation.",1,AI Generated (Gemini Studio)
"The ""Flynn Effect"" (rising IQ scores) has reversed in some developed nations. We analyzed cognitive test data from Scandinavian military conscripts. We found that the decline is driven by a drop in spatial and logic scores, while verbal scores remain steady. We hypothesize this is linked to a shift from active problem-solving play to passive digital consumption in adolescence.",1,AI Generated (Gemini Studio)
"We investigate the symbolism of ""Vanitas"" still-life paintings in the 17th century. Using computer vision to catalog objects in 10,000 paintings, we found a correlation between the prevalence of ""skull"" and ""rotten fruit"" motifs and outbreaks of the bubonic plague. This quantitative iconography confirms that these artworks served as collective trauma processing tools.",1,AI Generated (Gemini Studio)
"The ""Glass Cliff"" phenomenon describes women being promoted to leadership during crises. We analyzed CEO appointments in the Fortune 500 over 20 years. We confirm that women are 30% more likely to be appointed to struggling firms. However, we also found that when these women turn the company around, they are replaced by men at a higher rate than male turn-around CEOs, suggesting a ""Savior"" bias.",1,AI Generated (Gemini Studio)
We analyze the acoustics of the Paleolithic caves of Lascaux. We mapped the resonance frequencies of the cave chambers. We found that the locations with the most dense cave paintings correspond to the points of maximum acoustic resonance. This supports the theory that the paintings were part of a multisensory ritual experience involving chanting or music.,1,AI Generated (Gemini Studio)
"The ""Mandela Effect"" (collective false memory) is often dismissed. We conducted a large-scale memory test on pop culture icons. We found that false memories are not random but structurally consistent (e.g., specific visual features like a monocle). This suggests that the brain uses ""schema-filling"" generative processes to reconstruct memories, leading to predictable, shared errors.",1,AI Generated (Gemini Studio)
"We examine the economic impact of Universal Basic Income (UBI) on entrepreneurship. In a two-year pilot study, recipients of UBI were 40% more likely to start a small business than the control group. The guaranteed floor provided a ""risk cushion"" that encouraged innovation rather than inducing laziness, challenging the standard labor-leisure trade-off model.",1,AI Generated (Gemini Studio)
"The structural integrity of Gothic cathedrals relies on flying buttresses. We used laser scanning and finite element analysis to model the stress distribution in Notre Dame. We found that the medieval masons empirically optimized the curvature of the buttresses to align perfectly with the thrust lines of the vaulted ceiling, displaying an intuitive understanding of vector mechanics centuries before the math was formalized.",1,AI Generated (Gemini Studio)
"We investigate the ""Echo Chamber"" effect on Reddit. We analyzed the comment history of users who migrated between subreddits. We found that users who engaged with opposing viewpoints (e.g., visiting r/politics and r/conservative) did not moderate their views but actually became more extreme in their sentiment, suggesting that cross-cutting exposure can trigger ""backfire effects"" rather than depolarization.",1,AI Generated (Gemini Studio)
"The use of ""Spolia"" (reused ancient building materials) in medieval architecture is often seen as pragmatism. We analyzed the placement of Roman columns in Islamic mosques in Cordoba. We found a deliberate aesthetic pattern where specific colored marbles were used to mark the qibla wall. This indicates that spolia were used not just for convenience, but to appropriate the symbolic power of the preceding empire.",1,AI Generated (Gemini Studio)
"We explore the psychology of ""Nostalgia"" during crises. During the COVID-19 pandemic, streaming data showed a massive spike in the consumption of media from the users' adolescence. Psychological surveys confirmed that this ""media nostalgia"" served as a buffer against existential threat, providing a sense of continuity and social connectedness during isolation.",1,AI Generated (Gemini Studio)
"The ""efficient market hypothesis"" assumes rational actors. We analyzed the trading behavior of retail investors on ""meme stocks."" We found that social sentiment on Reddit predicted price movements better than fundamental financial indicators. This ""narrative economics"" suggests that markets are driven by contagion stories rather than discounted cash flows in the age of social trading.",1,AI Generated (Gemini Studio)
"We investigate the ""Chilling Effect"" of surveillance on creativity. Writers were asked to draft a short story while being told they were monitored by an AI productivity tracker. The monitored group produced stories with significantly lower lexical diversity and creativity scores than the control group, suggesting that performance surveillance induces risk-aversion and stifles divergent thinking.",1,AI Generated (Gemini Studio)
"The ""Sapir-Whorf Hypothesis"" suggests language shapes thought. We tested color perception in speakers of languages with different color taxonomies (e.g., distinguishing light/dark blue vs. just blue). We found that speakers with distinct terms were faster at discriminating color boundaries in a reaction time task, providing neuro-behavioral evidence that linguistic labels warp the perceptual space.",1,AI Generated (Gemini Studio)
"The study investigates how urban adolescents construct digital micro-identities across multiple social platforms. Using ethnographic interviews and longitudinal content analysis, the research identifies platform-specific “identity fragments” that remain stable or shift during major life transitions.
